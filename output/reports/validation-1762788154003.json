        "body": "Hi ShopEasy Commerce Team,\n\nI ran a quick accessibility audit on https://www.etsy.com and found 3 critical WCAG 2.2 violations that could expose you to ADA lawsuits.\n\nYour current compliance score: NaN/100 (LOW legal risk)\n\nTop issues blocking ecommerce users:\n- Images must have alternate text (critical - 11 instances)\n- Elements must have sufficient color contrast (serious - 9 instances)\n- Interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (serious - 6 instances)\n\nGiven that the average ecommerce company generates $2.1B in revenue, these gaps could be costing you:\n• 15-20% of potential customers (users with disabilities)\n• $75K-$350K average per ADA lawsuit settlement\n• SEO penalties (Google favors accessible sites)\n\nI've built an AI-powered scanner that:\n✓ Identifies violations with 95% accuracy (no false positives)\n✓ Drafts developer-ready remediation tickets\n✓ Generates executive PDF reports for stakeholders\n✓ Tracks compliance trends over time\n\nWould you be open to a 15-minute audit review call this week? I can share:\n• Your full violation report (with screenshots)\n• Estimated remediation effort (in dev hours)\n• ROI calculator for compliance investment\n\nBook time: [Your Calendly Link]\n\nOr reply with your availability and I'll send over the full report.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\nWCAG AI Compliance Consultant\n[Your Website]\n\nP.S. Attached is a screenshot showing one critical violation on your homepage. This is just 1 of 3 we found."
